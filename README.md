gchatHistory
============
Download your google chat history!

How to:
1. Go to script.google.com and create a new project
2. Copy/paste the code from getChatHistory.gs into the file
3. Change the variable person to whomever you want to get your chat history with
4. In the toolbar, make sure the program is running the setup function
5. Hit run!

The script will automatically create a google doc and paste all your chat history with that person in the doc. You may then download the doc to search/read through your history _much_ faster than through gmail.
